## What I did

This project involved creating a "Downloads" page for an existing client website. The features included having collapsible sections of download content to make navigating all the downloads easier. It also features WordPress and Advance Custom Fields integrations so that the end-user can easily add download sections and raw files for content.

## Project's Biggest Challenge

The biggest challenge was figuring out what parts of the UI to integrate with the [Advance Custom Field's](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/) plugin and also which input types should be mapped to those UI components. For the most part, most of the UI component's would be matched to [Text Field Type](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/resources/text/) within A.C.F. fortunately the [ACF Repeater Field Type](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/resources/repeater/) could be used to repeat each section of download content.


## What I took away

That proper planning, before any coding is done, can save and shave a lot of development time.
