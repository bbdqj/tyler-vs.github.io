<p>Hi, my name is Tyler. I mostly work on front end web development.</p>

<p>I have also worked on WordPress projects, doing theme development and third party plugin integrations. Over my career in web development I have developed a <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/projects.html">few projects</a> that I talk about.</p>

<p>While I work on both front-end development and WordPress development, I also have useful skills in designing and HTML Emails, please take a look at my <a href="/resume.html">resume</a>.</p>
