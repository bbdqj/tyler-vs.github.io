  A look into one of my old class projects. A Solar System web app.

One of the cool projects that I help build while attending university was called "Our Solar System". The project's goal, which needed to be accomplished in order to get a good grade, was to build an informative website. Our group decided to build a project that informs a user about planets and other [celestial bodies](http://www.universetoday.com/48671/celestial-body/) that are found in our own solar system.

To make this project work, [John](http://johnpanayiotou.com/), [Joey](http://joejensen.info/) and myself utilized a few different JavaScript libraries to make it work, including:

- [wow.js](http://mynameismatthieu.com/WOW/), for animating parts of the page as the user scrolls.
- [three.js](https://threejs.org/), was used to render the planets (and the sun).
- [bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), for styling, bootstrap came with some neat effects, such as the tabs which sped up the overall project.
- [d3](https://d3js.org/), was used to create gauges that showed the composition of planets.
- [jquery](https://jquery.com/), a dependency for the other libraries used.
- [stats.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/stats.js/), pretty sure we used this with three.js to help see the performance.
- [angular.js](https://angularjs.org/), used to create the quiz for the site.

Without a team effort this project would not of gotten as far as it did or even achieve the goals of the project. As a group were able to integrate helpful javascript libraries to build an interactive and informative website which hopefully allowed a user to learn a thing or two.

**Cool fact -** the project's lofty ambient music was created by one of our own talented team members, [John Panayiotou](http://johnpanayiotou.com/).
