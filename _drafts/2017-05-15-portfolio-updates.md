title: Portfolio Updates

Something frequently encountered when learning new material on the web is finding ways to use what you have just learned. For such occasions, I frequently use this very web portfolio project as a way to test things out. 
What makes this portfolio a good candidate is a few things: 

- Typically I deal with front-end matters, so I can use Jekyll for testing CSS/HTML and JS without having to create any form of software stack locally.
- The portfolio is powered by GitHub, so I can practice my git skills at the same time.
- As with most freely hosted GitHub portfolio pages, the repository is not private so employers/persons can easily check out what matters the most: the source code.
- Allows showing off of new skills learned to the WWW/future employer.
- If updated frequently, it shows more green on my GitHub portfolio activity chart.

## Being able to do it vs being able to do it well

As my web developer journey continues, the cycle that I usually am in is follows as:

1. learn new concept
2. complete tutorial code
3. integrate into a new or existing project
4. find or keep note of other applications for concept

When learning, it is important to learn the concept details (because sometimes the most minor of details can influence the whole system) yet also keep the bigger picture in mind - as in the last step (step 4). Step 4, is crucial in that many computer concepts are connected or are borrowed from other computer concepts, building these connections allows better understanding of a concept - borrowing ideas for one concept to make analogies/contrasts for another similar concept.

One problematic issue I have when implementing or integrating new concepts is using them without a real need. For example, when I learned about passing variables into Jekyll include partials, I quickly made a whole bunch of Jekyll partials for U.I. components that I never actually used like alerts, notes, figure, YouTube video. This was great for practice but not for the master repository that it eventually (and regrettably) got committed into. As a result, when I updated this portfolio project (a month later), I had to sort through a bloated project directory, scanning through theme partials that were at least functional but rarely used. 

I figure that for future learning, I would take a different approach to learning and to how I use newly learned material.

1. __learning appropriate things__, for someone without a job, learn things that immediately make a more employable you. As a front-end guy, this means having to skip the VIM tutorials in order to get comfortable with CSS grids. Or skipping over a PHP framework tutorial and looking into React or Angular instead.
2. __correct application__, going forth I hope to make code additions open source on GitHub, which is has pros and cons. The pro is having more activity shown in my GitHub user profile, the cons are finding meaningful projects to create, having a existing project to test on instead of creating a one off project.

Just my thoughts
